            Make an Impact With Sukruthi
          </h2>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Many people want to contribute to society, but their busy and
            stressed lives keep them from stepping on-ground and rendering their
            support. The best way out here is to provide financial assistance to
            an organization that can work towards the betterment of the lives of
            the underprivileged. Sukruthi Charitable Trust is one such
            organization for you.

            The most common queries our donors come with
          </h3>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Having come across thousands of donors, there are a few topics most
            of the donors struggle with. We will address your queries and help
            you in your philanthropic journey.
          </p>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Some of you may be wondering “is this even a question?”. How does
            this matter? You are right. You can donate on any day, all through
            the year. There is so much need out there in the world around us
            that every single day matters.
          </p>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Some people would write their contributions in their will. While it
            is welcome to give when you are no longer there, it also means that
            if you live forever (theoretically) you would never give it away.
            You would rather be remembered as the one who lived usefully than
            someone who died rich. You may want to spend it for a good cause
            while you are alive.
          </p>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Having said that, most of us make our decisions to donate based on
            personal connections. The heart is as important as the mind in
            charitable giving. We need a trigger for everything in our lives. So
            below are some of those triggers for you to donate to charitable
            causes. Feel free to choose one or more of them based on what
            pleases your heart. But most importantly, do it today or as soon as
            you can.

            Birthdays / Wedding Anniversaries of yourself, your spouse,
            children, parents, etc.
            <br />
            There is a wedding planned - either your own or one of your family
            members. Needless to say, a huge amount of money will be spent on
            the wedding for food, venue, gifts, etc. Great, a wedding is a
            memorable event in everyone’s life. While you spend so much, if you
            extend a little part of those expenses to charity, your wedding will
            be even more memorable.
            <br />
            You & your spouse were blessed with a healthy baby recently and your
            family members are elated over the new addition to your family.
            Think of those babies which are born with both their kidneys failed.
            Maybe you can spend some money on such babies to allow them to grow
            up and lead a healthy life in future.
            <br />
            In loving memory of your late parents/in-laws on their birth/death
            anniversary.
            <br />
            You just bought a new bike/car/home for yourself spending a huge
            amount of money. See if you can set aside a part of that expenditure
            towards charity.
            <br />
            We have plenty of festivals in India – Like Diwali, Pongal /
            Sankranti, Ugadi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Dussehra, Ramzan, Bakrid,
            Christmas, etc. – These are occasions on which we typically
            celebrate with family and friends. You could donate some amount of
            money on such days to allow someone else deprived of the joy of
            celebrating a festival smile.
            <br />
            You get a new job/promotion/salary hike in your company which gives
            you a significant jump in your earnings. You could donate some money
            to people who may not even have a job that pays them a decent living
            daily wage.
            <br />
            You may be a businessman who just bagged a big/prestigious contract
            which offers you the potential to earn huge profits. Think of
            someone who may not even be able to work due to an illness and
            donate some part of your profits.
            <br />
            You just spent a lot of money on some medical treatment in a private
            hospital for yourself or a family member. Some people are suffering
            from various health problems and they can’t even afford post-surgery
            medicines after receiving free treatment in Govt hospitals. You may
            want to help such people to recover and get their lives back on
            track.
            <br />
            You got your son or daughter admitted into a reputed private
            school/college recently incurring huge expenditure on fees, books,
            etc. Think of those people who do not have money to satisfy their
            hunger (they go to school bcos of the free meal they get) and donate
            towards their educational expenses.
          </p>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            This list can go on & on. Please note, you don’t have to be guilty
            of spending on any of the above events in your lives. You are
            entitled to have a good time for yourself and your family. After
            all, that is what we all earn for. All we are asking you to do is to
            keep in mind those people who do not have these privileges and show
            your compassion. That’s it.

          <p className="idea-content-p">
            This is probably the easiest question to answer. When giving to
            charity, the size of your donation directly correlates with the
            number of people you can help. But you don’t have to be a
            millionaire to make a difference. Even small donations have the
            potential to dramatically improve an individual’s quality of life.
          </p>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            The best use of money is not to make more money but to make money do
            more for the good of mankind. It doesn’t matter how much you give as
            long as you give something. Each person should donate what his / her
            heart says, not reluctantly or under compulsion.

            <strong>
              Rigveda (verse – 3.24.5) says, “शतहस्त समाहर सहस्त्र हस्त सं किर”
              means earn with hundreds of hands and donate with thousands of
              hands.{" "}
            </strong>
            A bit of fragrance always clings to the hand that gives roses. So be
            as liberal and as generous as you can.

            As a donor, you may want to choose exactly where you want your
            contributions to go, you want to have an impact with your giving. If
            this is your first time donating, it might get a little overwhelming
            to find the best causes to get behind from the millions of causes
            out there in the world. There are causes ranging from education to
            climate change to nutrition to health care and many more. Some
            popular causes may already be getting a lot of resources. But what
            you may not know is that they have a greater need for funding as
            well. The most important factor to decide is - Which causes are you
            most passionate about? You should choose between multiple causes
            based on your values and donate to areas you're especially
            passionate about.

            A cancer diagnosis for just Rs. 13,000
          </h3>

          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Early diagnosis of cancer focuses on detecting symptomatic patients
            as early as possible so they have the best chance for successful
            treatment. When cancer care is delayed or inaccessible there is a
            lower chance of survival, greater problems associated with treatment
            and higher costs of care. Early diagnosis improves cancer outcomes
            by providing care at the earliest possible stage.
          </p>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Due to ignorance, fear, and social stigma many people present with
            stage III or IV cancer which requires surgery and extensive
            treatment. If detected early, then in most cases there will be less
            aggressive treatment and better chances of recovery. Early diagnosis
            includes several tests and procedures including imaging tests like
            PET/CT, MRI and bone scans or X-rays, to see if cancer has spread to
            other parts of the body.
          </p>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            Unfortunately, many people in India cannot afford the high costs of
            PET/CT scans resulting in delaying their cancer treatment. This is
            where Sukruthi can fund their diagnosis if you donate just Rs.
            13,000.

            Chemo Ports for just for Rs. 7,500
          </h3>

          <p className="idea-content-p">
            A chemo port is a small device that is implanted under your skin
            below the collar bone to allow easy access to your bloodstream. The
            advantage of this vein-access device is that chemotherapy
            medications can be delivered directly into the vein, eliminating the
            need for multiple needle pricks at every chemotherapy cycle. It can
            be used if you need transfusions of red blood cells or platelets. A
            chemo port is very beneficial to a patient because it decreases the
            anxiety of multiple pricks, decreases the chances of extravasation
            injuries and thrombophlebitis, leading to hassle-free treatments. A
            chemo port is now the standard practice of care all around the world
            for patients receiving chemotherapy. It helps the cancer patients by
            bringing ease and comfort for taking chemotherapy, thereby
            increasing the compliance for treatment, especially for children.
            But it is still quite expensive in India making it unaffordable for
            poor patients forcing them to go through chemotherapy without the
            chemo port. A chemo port would typically cost upwards of Rs. 25,000
            in a private hospital in India but you can donate just Rs. 7,500 to
            Sukruthi who will make it available for the needy children.

            Hemodialysis for adults/children for just Rs. 10,000 per month
          </h3>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            There are two options for ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease) patients in
            India - Hospital-based Hemodialysis (HD) or home-based Peritoneal
            Dialysis [CAPD]. HD is the most common modality in India. In HD, the
            blood is filtered through a machine that acts like an artificial
            kidney and is returned to the body. HD needs to be performed in a
            designated dialysis centre. It is usually needed about 3 times per
            week, with each episode taking about 3-4 hours. ESRD patients need
            to undergo dialysis for several years before they get a transplant
            which could cost them anywhere between Rs. 15-20,000 per month. You
            can partner with Sukruthi to support a person to undergo HD for
            several years just by paying Rs. 10,000 per month.

            Peritoneal Dialysis for children for just Rs. 18000 per month{" "}
          </h3>
          <p className="idea-content-p">
            With its ambulatory nature and freedom from complicated and
            expensive technology, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the ideal renal
            replacement therapy for resource-poor India. While HD requires
            sophisticated infrastructure and human resources, PD is delivered at
            home by patients themselves or a caregiver and does not require
            infrastructure. Children typically need to undergo PD twice a day,
            every day of the month for the entire year and several years before
            they become eligible for a transplant. And it would cost anywhere
            between Rs. 20-25000 per month making it extremely difficult for
            them to afford this treatment. In most cases, the monthly income for
            such people will not be that much and spending it on the treatment
            of one child is unimaginable leading to child mortality. You can
            partner with Sukruthi to support a child to undergo PD for several
            years just by paying Rs. 18,000 per month. When you donate to
            Sukruthi, you are not just making a gift - you are transforming
            lives.
