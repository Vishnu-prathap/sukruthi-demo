            <strong>Benefits of Systematic Donation Plans</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Stable, Reliable & Dependable source of income</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            For us, it is a source of reliable financial support and brings in
            predictability which allows us to plan how many more people we can
            support in the coming months. Dependable sources of income are
            especially valuable in the wake of the uncertainties that Covid-19
            brought in 2020. Monthly donations are an opportunity for us to
            secure a steady stream of income to get us through the year and the
            challenges that come with it.

            <strong>Minimize admin effort </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most NGOs, Sukruthi also has a very lean staff to run our
            operations. Monthly donations allow us to keep the admin work
            minimal to keep our operations running smoothly. Imagine the amount
            of time required to reach out to new donors and follow up with them
            for raising funds. All that time would be saved if those donors gave
            automatically on a monthly basis.{" "}

          <p>
            <strong>Easier for Donors</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people want to do their bit for the society and are looking for
            ways to give. It may be daunting for donors if we ask for one large
            donation. But asking for a monthly contribution can seem more
            manageable for them, like paying their other bills. Ultimately,
            smaller donations in steady increments add up and can be more
            valuable than one-time donations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this way you are holding yourself accountable to your commitment
            to use your personal resources to fight the effects of extreme
            poverty in India.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            With a strong foundation of donors, we can better support our
            earth-changing work in the long run.
